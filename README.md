Simple parametric bearing holder for Lulzbot TAZ 300x300 build plates.

Should fit to the bed holder at https://www.lulzbot.com/products/300-x-300mm-bed-plate-mount

I needed LM8UU holders for a TAZ plate, so here we are.

Lulzbearing-2 is a modified design, inspired by the TAZ 'Juniper' 10mm bearing holders.
